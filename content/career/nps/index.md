As the data manager for the Southern Colorado Plateau Network of the Inventory and Monitoring Division, I participated in all aspects of our network monitoring projects including protocol development, database development, data summary and visualization, and reporting. My particular area of focus was on data management. I balanced the needs of each project and set work priorities for the data management team.  I directly supervised three employees; a Data Specialist, a GIS Specialist, and a GIS and Data Management Technician.   
 
Primary duties included:

*	Understanding project objectives and data to build appropriate data models
*	Planning, building, testing, and maintaining all network databases
*	Transitioning data from dysfunctional databases to new databases using ETL techniques in R 
*	Extracting data from multiple data sources using ODBC connections
*	Creating data views and summaries that standardize formats and facilitate reporting 
*	Advising and training coworkers in using R for data management, data exploration, and data analysis
*	Assisting with developing protocols, creating visualizations, and creating reports and manuscripts
*	Managing the data management team including setting team priorities and balancing task loads
*	Applying my ecological experience to solving monitoring issues and facilitating reporting
