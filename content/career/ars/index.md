We focused on exploring the relationship between oyster aquaculture and coastal ecosystems using habitat and population surveys, mapping, manipulative and observational field and lab experiments, and remote sensing.  I spent a significant portion of my time organizing, summarizing, and analyzing the results of these efforts to promote sustainable and productive aquaculture practices. I also collaborated with Federal, State, and Tribal researchers, oyster farmers, and the general public to set priorities, accomplish research objectives, and share the results of our research.       
 
Primary duties included:  
*	conducting research on the interaction between oyster aquaculture and burrowing shrimp (pest), seagrass (imperiled), juvenile fish, and crabs (commercially important)
*	mapping seagrass, burrowing shrimp, sediment characteristics, and oyster aquaculture over multiple years in several west coast estuaries for use in modeling system dynamics
*	long-term monitoring of burrowing shrimp population extent, population structure, and recruitment
*	acquiring, managing, analyzing, visualizing, documenting, and distributing spatial data including managing and processing several years of 4-band remote sensing data
*	modeling the relationship between oyster aquaculture and seagrass to determine aquaculture impacts
*	preparing and reviewing protocols, analysis processes, and reports 
*	collaborating with researchers from a variety of government agencies (EPA, USGS, ODFW, WDFW) and universities (Univ. of Washington, Oregon State, Washington State University) 
*	supervising and training interns, students, and coworkers
*	planning and conducting field visits, creating work plans, supervising team members, budgeting time and equipment, purchasing, managing, and maintaining equipment and supplies
